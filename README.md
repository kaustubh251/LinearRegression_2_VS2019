# LinearRegression_2_VS2019
In this repository, I learnt to handle '.csv' file. I also automated certain processes.
This linear regression predicts salary based on the experience of the employee.
The function used for curve fitting is salary = a0 + a1*experience + a2*experience*experience + a3*experience*experience*experience
The program takes experience as an input and gives salary and regression coefficient as output
